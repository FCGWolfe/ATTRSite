<p align="center"> This is a WIP Test version of the ATTR Homepage.

It's static, plain, boring, and looks like it barely survived the 90s, but it's a first. <br>

It'll eventually move beyond plain HTML but for now, this is what you get. Sorry, mobile users. </p> <br>

<p align="center"> Links to an assortment of random shit that has nothing to do with ATTR but is here anyway. </p> <br>
